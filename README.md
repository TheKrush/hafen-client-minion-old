Custom Haven & Hearth Client

_This is a fork of [Ender's client](http://www.havenandhearth.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=40754) so it'll contain *most* of the changes made to that client._

**Installation:**
Download [hafen-minion.jar](http://thekrush.github.io/hafen-client-minion/hafen-minion.jar) (to a empty folder) and run it. It will download all necessary files to folder where it is placed.

**Changes:**

* Option to save minimap ([Ender's client](http://www.havenandhearth.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=40754))

  * CTRL+LEFT CLICK (take 1 item from stockpile)

* Zoom in/out camera with numpad +/- ([Ender's client](http://www.havenandhearth.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=40754))
